#### Testing

- When writing tests, you should not focus on what an object is, but on what the object does. What this object does is vastly more important

- It is important that you write a failing test first and see if fail. If you don't do that you can't tell if the test you wrote doesn't capture the scenario story you need to implement and that the code you wrote does what you think it does
