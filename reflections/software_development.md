#### Software development

- Inspite of all attempts to replicate the production environment in staging or development, it is a different environment and may raise up a set of bugs or issues that don't come up before the first release in the development (and staging) environments. To avoid those issues messing up your release plans: 
        - Deploy to production early and often in your pre release period.
        - Alpha test the production environment before making it public.

- Longevity of code is what causes a programmer to become a software engineer.

- If code is not maintainable, over time, the rate at which developers can introduce new features will diminish until they spend more time tracking down unexpected regressions and unpicking spaghetti code than actually getting work done. At some point the software will cost more to improve than the revenue it can generate. - _The RSpec Book_

- A common assumption by the program board at the Coding phase (after Planning and Analysis) is that all the 'hard thinking' has been done by this stage. 

- The later in the process of software development that you find a bug, the more expensive it is to fix. It won't be surprizing to me if its about 10 times more expensive to fix a big after release than before that. 

- It is important to manage releases appropriately. It is imporant to get the attention of stake holders early, and to LOCK in the features and not have any feature requests be added near the release date. If stakeholders want features added near the deadline it is important that the release is pushed for a few more iterations. 

- Fast feedback cycles, whether from your stakeholders, your test suite or CI is an important factor in being able to write good code

- The business rule of undercommmit and overdeliver applies to software development
