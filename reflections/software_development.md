#### Software development

- Inspite of all attempts to replicate the production environment in staging or development, it is a different environment and may raise up a set of bugs or issues that don't come up before the first release in the development (and staging) environments. To avoid those issues messing up your release plans: 
        - Deploy to production early and often in your pre release period.
        - Alpha test the production environment before making it public.
