#### Design

- Good names drive good design

- A decorator (generic definition):
  * Wraps a single object
  * Has a transparent interface
  * Forwards methods to original objects - Maintainable Templates by Loudermilk ( Railsconf 2013 )

- The best time to design a good API is when you are building an app against it. Similarly, the best time to write a library, is when you need it for an application.
