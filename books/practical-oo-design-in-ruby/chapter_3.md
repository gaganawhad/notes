#### Chapter 3 - Managing dependencies

##### Dependency Injection
  - Sometimes an object depends on another for it's behavior. creating an instance of the object in the behavior itself can cause the classes to be tightly coupled. Dependency Injection is the software design pattern by which the object is actually passed to the initializer. This causes the objects to be less tightly coupled.
